### Useful Hack

Agent, we really need to log in to the Slootmaekers site as one of the gang - it looks like it has functionality for them to exchange messages about their heist plans. Time is running out and we need to know what they're saying.

We don't have a username and password combination for any of the gang members, but it just occurred to one of our agents that a big popular dutch social media site called Gellukkig was recently hacked and a bunch of **username and password combinations** posted online. There's a small chance one of those was one of the gang members and they've **re-used the details** for the login on the site.

**Tip:** **Login to the site** as a gang member to get the flag.
